## about me

I’m a second-year M.S. student at Sungkyunkwan University, where I am advised by [_Prof. Sungeun Hong_](https://www.csehong.com). I am broadly interested in model efficiency and transfer. My current research focuses on model compression, multi-task model merging, and test-time adaptation.
